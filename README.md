## Extract, Transform, and Load

In this project, the team of Terrell Bradford, Michael Cipriani, Ashleigh DeVito, Laura Kemp, and Sam Pierce sought to build a database of information related to New York State car accidents.

Data was gathered from:

    United States Census Bureau for [Population and Demographics](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/popest-popproj/popest.html)
    Data USA for [Income](https://datausa.io/api/data?drilldowns=County&measures=Household%20Income)
    Kaggle for [Accident Data](US_Accidents_raw.csv)

The ata was then cleaned using Jupyter Notebooks and loaded into an Amazon Web Service database.
